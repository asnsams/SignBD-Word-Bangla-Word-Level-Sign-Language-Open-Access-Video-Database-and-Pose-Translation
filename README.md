# SignBD-Word: Bangla Word-Level Sign Language Video Database with Pose Translation

Bangla sign language (BdSL) is a unique and complete natural language with its own distinct linguistic characteristics. Despite the existence of video datasets for many well-known sign languages, no publicly available dataset has existed for word-level BdSL‚Äîuntil now.

In this study, we introduce **SignBD-Word**, a comprehensive, video-based dataset containing **6000 sign videos** that represent **200 unique Bangla words**. This dataset provides both **full and upper-body views** of the signers and includes **2D body pose information** for each video. It is designed to serve as a valuable benchmark for testing and evaluating sign video classification algorithms.

## Key Features

- **Dataset Size**: 6000 sign videos
- **Unique Words**: 200 Bangla words
- **Video Quality**: 1920x1080 (HD) RGB videos
- **Views**: Full and upper-body perspectives
- **Pose Information**: 2D body pose frames for each video

## Dataset Usage

SignBD-Word is suitable for research on Bangla sign language recognition, as well as pose-based translation models. This dataset is designed to be a benchmark for **word-level BdSL classification algorithms** and provides extensive data for **pose to pose translation tasks**.
